config right but you do have an example for Duo on namely the machines on campus are release The corn machines work just the way I and are at least appear to configured by integrating Duo into PAM along with what I want to how did they do but it should work following the official Duo but That page has a link to the official page at which is the same one I used to set up Duo on our Centos Their configuration produce a working as I posted in my original HelpSU Once Duo is configured into PAM according to I can log in to the box using my kerberos credentials exactly as with no prompt for a second pretty is that the official Duo docs take into account that we have in the auth and their simple config work in that The corn admins have found another way to integrate Duo into PAM so it works correctly with Kerberos From what I can see on they have modified to include the auth required The problem I know what other fixes they had to if and I view the contents of the which might be Are you

they but prefer to I like this uncertainty We normally have two disks on hand for two different systems which live in the same rack and The disks from one system are a different brand than the other and we try to have identical So that accounts for I understand the It is possible that we got one back from warranty coverage after purchasing a replacement for a previous disk that went I recall putting it there but I might Since Alex correctly gave the previous bad disk to the above is the only way I can explain the presence of a fifth I just sent Micah a message to check whether he ever put a disk I doubt This would mean the fifth disk is just me forgetting which happens about every so is a pretty good Now that I think of there is also another the replacement that Alex used had to come from so we would expect there to be disks not This is getting Your test sounds like a very good Is there any kind of serial number that would have been logged by the FreeNAS system which we could or can a disk be checked to determine whether formatted for This would allow us to identify any used I think somewhat unlikely disks are being destroyed but firmware interactions do seem to cause bizarre

but the commands succeeded via the other This happen frequently but does happen usually it is not indicative of anything in It seems now like it may have been an early warning sign of disk but it is difficult to know with The error messages you sent on the are indicative of failure a disk might have ONE medium error now and then but a bunch in succession are cause for it seems that the disk clearly fail until the which is but that is apparently what Yesterday when the disk that was called was it generated so many errors that it show up to the operating It might mean the disk was bad or it could be an issue with the storage I hoped rebooting the system would reset the storage system bus and allow the system to see the new that did not Combined with the multipath issue we saw the might be something wrong with the storage backplane or even the physical what I will try to figure out My immediate goal is to get the system resilvering To clarify about the number of disk spares after replacing the disk on the should there have been two remaining or were there two spares initially going down to one We have some spare disks I can borrow from another system for follow up after I am onsite about the data movement to your newer archive I wanted to mention it but I want to try to deal with everything one thing at a The disk slot associated with is part of if that If like I can give you a status call once I know something My cell is the area code seems to cause people I hope this Thank you for your patience with sorting out the We have already contacted Colfax so they are

moment just test the Subsequently we should record the serial numbers of bad you are spot on freenas creates a special partitioning scheme that we can check The first partition is a small swap and the second partition is used for For the other that was I recall what I was trying to say exactly but I expect I meant that Colfax seems to be working on getting us the appropriate some of our other systems have gone through pretty large numbers of disk failures that the vendor blamed on firmware it is something that Colfax might help Will On December at PM ej I thought there were only two spares normal Hence I thought Alex might have left a bad disk But it seems I was wrong about based on your email a few days after the break began I originally For clarity still a little confused about There are two toshiba disks and I believe seagate Is that I guess I want to put them in another machine next week and just verify that they pass SMART I think they but prefer to I like this uncertainty We normally have two disks on hand for two different systems which live in the same rack and The disks from one system are a different brand than the other and we try to have identical So that accounts for I understand the It is possible that we got one back from warranty coverage after purchasing a replacement for a previous disk that went I recall putting it there but I might Since Alex correctly gave the previous bad disk to the above is the only way I can explain the presence of a fifth I just sent Micah a message to check whether he ever put a disk I doubt This would mean the fifth disk is just me forgetting which happens about every so is a pretty good Now that I think of there is also another the replacement that Alex used had to come from so we would expect there to be disks not This is getting Your test sounds like a very good Is there any kind of serial number that would have been logged by the FreeNAS system which we could or can a disk be checked to determine whether formatted for This would allow us to identify any used I think somewhat unlikely disks are being destroyed but firmware interactions do seem to cause bizarre behavior which seen on some of our other It sounds like they are moving ahead on I replied to I fully understand this comment but will wait to hear more from you on ej On December at PM William Law Hi EJ in italics hopefully with just in My immediate goal is to get the system resilvering Thank I agree with the top priority to If you can accomplish everything else can wait until after the break is This is finally The usb disk is just a but it will

to be I think that issue is resolved missed a message of yours some days I sent a message to colfax inquiring about I have no idea how to select data copy to be a backup for the data on the missing If you let me awaiting your next ej On December at AM William Law Hi There have been a bunch of different threads about the cosmic storage I hope covering everything but if missed anything please tell First the immediate issue involving the disk formerly known as The initial issue last week was a multipathing All the SAS disks in the server have two paths to their storage just had one of the paths but the commands succeeded via the other This happen frequently but does happen usually it is not indicative of anything in It seems now like it may have been an early warning sign of disk but it is difficult to know with The error messages you sent on the are indicative of failure a disk might have ONE medium error now and then but a bunch in succession are cause for it seems that the disk clearly fail until the which is but that is apparently what Yesterday when the disk that was called was it generated so many errors that it show up to the operating It might mean the disk was bad or it could be an issue with the storage I hoped rebooting the system would reset the storage system bus and allow the system to see the new that did not Combined with the multipath issue we saw the might be something wrong with the storage backplane or even the physical what I will try to figure out My immediate goal is to get the system resilvering To clarify about the number of disk spares after replacing the disk on the should there have been two remaining or were there two spares initially going down to one We have some spare disks I can borrow from another system for follow up after I am onsite about the data movement to your newer archive I wanted to mention it but I want to try to deal with everything one thing at a The disk slot associated with is part of if that If like I can

noon tomorrow as we discussed via FaceTime to work on the disk Will On December at PM William Law Hi EJ The system is back Having a disk in the bay that had the drive failure generates errors and kept the machine from rebooting The issue continues to be SAS bus errors is still continuing when we place a disk in the drive the system detect disks in that bay for the Is it still under warranty from work on plans to troubleshoot the issue We tried multiple disks so it seems to be an issue with the Currently the system is up but one of the VDEVs from is missing a disk and in degraded Will On December at PM ej Yes On December at PM William Law Hi EJ Is it OK for us to reboot the getting scsi bus errors preventing the new disk from coming and I hope that will clear Will On December at PM ej Sorry to bother you this disk was also giving us some hiccups before the break addition to so it has me a bit said it was OK but I am before the Stephane swapped a but left it sitting with the other

until after the break is To clarify about the number of disk spares after replacing the disk on the should there have been two remaining or were there two spares initially going down to one I thought

of yours some days I sent a message to colfax inquiring about I have no idea how to select data copy to be a backup for the data on the missing If you let me awaiting your next ej On December at AM William Law Hi There have been a bunch of different threads about the cosmic storage I hope covering everything but if missed anything please tell First the immediate issue involving the disk formerly known as The initial issue last week was a multipathing All the SAS disks in the server have two paths to their storage just had one of the paths but the commands succeeded via the other This happen frequently but does happen usually it is not indicative of anything in It seems now like it may have been an early warning sign of disk but it is difficult to know with The error messages you sent on the are indicative of failure a disk might have ONE medium error now and then but a bunch in succession are cause for it seems that the disk clearly fail until the which is but that is apparently what Yesterday when the disk that was called was it generated so many errors that it show up to the operating It might mean the disk was bad or it could be an issue with the storage I hoped rebooting the system would reset the storage system bus and allow the system to see the new that did not Combined with the multipath issue we saw the might be something wrong with the storage backplane or even the physical what I will try to figure out My immediate goal is to get the system resilvering To clarify about the number of disk spares after replacing the disk on the should there have been two remaining or were there two spares initially going down to one We have some spare disks I can borrow from another system for follow up after I am onsite about the data movement to your newer archive I wanted to mention it but I want to try to deal with everything one thing at a The disk slot associated with is part of if that If like I can give you a status call once I know something My cell is the area code seems to cause people I hope this Thank you for your patience with sorting out the We have already contacted Colfax so they are aware we may need Will On December at PM ej My mobile is Please have this handy in case serious issues come ej On December at PM ej Thanks for the I somewhat doubt under about years I can check if you think it might At this my concern is being at risk of data There is no real Is there a way to make a copy of the good until back can we put the old disk back in so that there is RAID Let me know the plan you come up ej By the sorry to intrude on your I did bring up the and warnings with Kilian or Stephane before the break remember and they decided not to act on Since we have potential data loss I appreciate your focused On December at PM Alexandra Hi be here from noon until so whenever is convenient for Alexandra On December at PM William Law Hi Alexandra I just wanted to confirm come over at noon tomorrow as we discussed via FaceTime to work on the disk Will On December at PM William Law Hi EJ The system is back Having a disk in the bay that had the drive failure generates errors and kept the machine from rebooting The issue continues to be SAS bus errors is still continuing when we place a disk in the drive the system detect disks in that bay for the Is it still under warranty from work on plans to troubleshoot the issue We tried multiple disks so it seems to be an issue with the Currently the system is up but one of the VDEVs from is missing a disk and in degraded Will On December at PM ej Yes On December at PM William Law Hi EJ Is it OK for us to reboot the getting scsi bus errors preventing the new disk from coming and I hope that will clear Will On December at PM ej Sorry to bother you this disk was also giving us some hiccups before the break addition to so it has me a bit said it was OK but I am before the Stephane swapped a but left it sitting with the other new replacement disks so not sure which is good and which is This is not a good situation since we only have replacement Can we get this cleared ej Begin forwarded On December at PM ej It will ej On December at PM Alexandra Lomita in room phone On

all those values do is set your ulimit value in the job So I would try running the same code elsewhere and seeing what ulimit values are set when it runs It has something to do with exactly how the program allocates memory and how it handles memory allocation Usually we see issues with Java because they allocate the same amount for stack and heap or something like so setting without makes them So my claim is that if you take your program on some other machine and set your ulimit the same way with something ulimit ulimit you should see it fail in the same And then you have to figure out how

configuration produce a working as I posted in my original HelpSU Once Duo is configured into PAM according to I can log in to the box using my kerberos credentials exactly as with no prompt for a second pretty is that the official Duo docs take into account that we have in the auth and their simple config work in that The corn admins have found another way to integrate Duo into PAM so it works correctly with Kerberos From what I can see on they have modified to include the auth required The problem I know what other fixes they had to if and I view the contents of the which might be Are you

First the immediate issue involving the disk formerly known as The initial issue last week was a multipathing All the SAS disks in the server have two paths to their storage just had one of the paths but the commands succeeded via the other This happen frequently but does happen usually it is not indicative of anything in It seems now like it may have been an early warning sign of disk but it is difficult to know with The error messages you sent on the are indicative of failure a disk might have ONE medium error now and then but a bunch in succession are cause for it seems that the disk clearly fail until the which is but that is apparently what Yesterday when the disk that was called was it generated so many errors that it show up to the operating It might mean the disk was bad or it could be an issue with the storage I hoped rebooting the system would reset the storage system bus and allow the system to see the new that did not Combined with the multipath issue we saw the
