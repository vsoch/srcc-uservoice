point of everything was The job it ended exited with meaning and the job was So we need to look at the debugging info from the actual application which generated the error in this As Morteza points the error message from supernova No heartbeat detected for Assuming job has This may be due to a user manually terminating the or the operating system or cluster terminating it due to resource or time

at a So say you have a script to Make sure it will run for the longer allowed runtime by using you can add to that and submit it a few as many times as you need to cover its total required So for if you need it to run for you submit your job and only will run at a When the is the one will start and so If the application automatically checkpoints and is able to resume from where it it should be transparent and in the you should be able to get your days If you have multiple you can do the same for each edit to add then submit it times with sbatch edit to add then submit it times with sbatch

pushing out an updated Sherlock in the new here are the differences between Sherlock and Sherlock has a free tier and allow compute nodes is SCG has more storage of GPFS vs of Lustre for but is Sherlock also has a free storage tier not sure for but I think you have to pay for what you There is more software installed on compared to But if you are using this matter that Sherlock has GPUs and Infiniband has more memory per node on average Given the news that Sherlock be ready likely by my suggestion is the get the test analysis going on Sherlock free and the resources needed for testing are When time to run we can look at prices for and Sherlock You can choose based on optimizing those two It may even be the case that you can get started on Sherlock while the second option is getting

researchers in the world to establish a program for global interdisciplinary scientific work and to boost research production in The Library of Alexandria is well situated to accomplish this with your help as it was reborn in in the same spot it occupied since ancient times years The new library is recapturing the spirit of the ancient library with the most modern technology of this new century to establish research across and to improve research in The Ancient library brought together the most interesting minds of antiquity and encouraged them to mingle freely across cultures and disciplines we hope to do the same with you and other From this approach was born perhaps the most significant breakthroughs the world had Aristarchus stated that the earth revolves around the years before Euclid wrote his Elements of which is the only text book still in use from ancient Library women in astronomy Chemistry owe much of their existence to the Library as the result of the interaction of thinkers in different disciplines bouncing ideas off of each We see now in this virtual this is indeed possible time for the Library to foster interdisciplinary and international We need to break out of our We invite you to join the BA Grid The Library of Alexandria Global Grid of science will shortly have million The library is indeed the library as much of science sprang from Alexandria Besides the need

at a So say you have a script to Make sure it will run for the longer allowed runtime by using you can add to that and submit it a few as many times as you need to cover its total required So for if you need it to run for you submit your job and only will run at a When the is the one will start and so If the application automatically checkpoints and is able to resume from where it it should be transparent and in the you should be able to get your days If you have multiple you can do the same for each edit to add then submit it times with sbatch edit to add then submit it times with sbatch

Sherlock also has a free storage tier not sure for but I think you have to pay for what you There is more software installed on compared to But if you are using this matter that Sherlock has GPUs and

of the server to share with other The next version of Supernova will attempt to limit resources better as well as provide more Best Dave Lin Genomics Software Field Operations Zhiyong Aug PDT Hi I think the issues Morteze had for that particular situation is that he is out of disk Their group has reached the quota of of disk sapce and we increased their Hopefully this time it is going to work On some of the compute nodes we do allow sharing of resource by multiple We are almost certain that the amount of memory should be enough for his job to finish though since the other jobs sharing are typically using very limited amount of We see more and more users using for assembly on different platforms at We are looking forward to the next release and hoping that we can have a better understanding of the resources required with the new Thank you very much for your continued Zhiyong Click to give Zhiyong Zhang David Aug PDT One more Can you confirm what organism you are trying to Are you assembling your own dataset or one of our publicly available sample human Thanks Dave Dave Lin Genomics Software Field Operations David Aug PDT Hi Chekh seen two main types of Dataset specific issues as with one of unique This is typically solved by giving Supernova dedicated access to the Supernova with other programs competing for resources on the The dataset Morteza is analyzing has been run many so inclined to believe it Can you try running your analysis on a dedicated server with sufficient like to see if that solves the It is possible that there is a third type of Supernova is still a relatively new It is possible that Supernova has some type of incompatibility with your particular Dave Lin Genomics Software Field Operations Aug PDT Hi On this the CPU assignments are managed with cgroups and the memory limit is managed with So the CPU pinning would be transparent to the but the memory limits would get enforced by SGE with In this the job was not so it never hit

the supernova upload for this latest see if there happens to be anything in the logs to give us a Thanks Dave Dave Lin Genomics Software Field Operations David Aug PDT HI The current version of Supernova has minimal The next version out in about a will have improved The heartbeat error usually signals that the cluster killed a It then aborts after waiting If the program we would typically see a different type of error Was anything else running on the server when Supernova was Supernova expects to have access to the entire If another job is running and using up resources it can cause Supernova to Dave Lin Genomics Software Field Operations Aug PDT Hi I took a look at job failed I think the runtime was a red herring as the job ran in job queue that does not have time So from Grid point of everything was The job it ended exited with meaning and the job was So we need to look at the debugging info from the actual application which generated the error in this As Morteza points the error message from supernova No heartbeat detected for Assuming job has This may be due to a user manually terminating the or the operating system or cluster terminating it due to resource or time It would be nice to know more about how that heartbeat A simple test would be to run exactly the same job again and see if it errors out again in exactly the same after the same Alex Hi Your

researchers in the world to establish a program for global interdisciplinary scientific work and to boost research production in The Library of Alexandria is well situated to accomplish this with your help as it was reborn in in the same spot it occupied since ancient times years The new library is recapturing the spirit of the ancient library with the most modern technology of this new century to establish research across and to improve research in The Ancient library brought together the most interesting minds of antiquity and encouraged them to mingle freely across cultures and disciplines we hope to do the same with you and other From this approach was born perhaps the most significant breakthroughs the world had Aristarchus stated that the earth revolves around the years before Euclid wrote his Elements of which is the only text book still in use from ancient Library women in astronomy Chemistry owe much of their existence to the Library as the result of the interaction of thinkers in different disciplines bouncing ideas off of each We see now in this virtual this is indeed possible time for the Library to foster interdisciplinary and international We need to break out of our We invite you to join the BA Grid The Library of Alexandria Global Grid of science will shortly have million The library is indeed the library as much of science sprang from Alexandria Besides the need for interdisciplinary research a critical problem in is that of the lack of research methods Research methods is at the core of all We have built a research methods library of Here we have one of the largest research methods as well as the Encyclopedia of Here we present projects to which the library We would love to have you join and be a part of Association for the Advancement of Science

at a So say you have a script to Make sure it will run for the longer allowed runtime by using you can add to that and submit it a few as many times as you need to cover its total required So for if you need it to run for you submit your job and only will run at a When the is the one will start and so If the application automatically checkpoints and is able to resume from where it it should be transparent and in the you should be able to get your days If you have multiple you can do the same for each edit to add then submit it times with sbatch edit to add then submit it times with sbatch
