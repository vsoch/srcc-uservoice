to setup ACLs on Did that We can help if what we because the Workgroup Manager can only be used to manage a Oak group or with associated quota Technically we could create projects like not managed by Stanford Workgroup but that means each of them would have its own quota which not sure would be very convenient for Let me know what you Best Stephane Thiell Research Computing removed by Click to give Stephane Thiell On Jul at AM Erik Ingelsson I logged into the Manager and it was really simple very Is it possible to create a subgroup that should have access to imaging and other bulk Or is it better to create a separate The reason for asking is that the current group are those that are approved to use but we have also previous uploaded common accelerometry and possibly other bulk to And the access privileges to these data sets should not be the We could for example have a number of subfolders in Like and And two access where one is for and one for other Or set access to the genomics subfolder to equal the and give individual permissions for the Erik Erik FAHA Professor of Stanford University on behalf of Kilian Cavalotti July at AM Erik Ingelsson Stefan Gustafsson UK Biobank

I added the accounts it will take up to for the changes to Kilian removed by Click to give Kilian Cavalotti On Jul at PM Erik Ingelsson Hi Stefan is away on but I think that Kilian or Stephane at Sherlock support can add these students to the group needed for getting access to the UKBB genomics and perhaps also for the accelerometer data remember how we set it up if there are two different UKBB These students are listed on my so they can be allowed Erik Erik FAHA Professor of Stanford University James Zou July at PM Erik Ingelsson Stefan Gustafsson UK Biobank Application data now Hi Could you give these students below access to the genotype data and the new data They can access the phenotype data The students Abubakar Abid Ruishan Liu Xinkun Nie Amirata Ghorbani James On Jun at Erik Ingelsson Hi Stefan Gustafsson is handling the permissions to the phenotype Please add all of the following users to both and James Zou Abubakar Abid Ruishan Liu Xinkun Nie Amirata Ghorbani Lu Zhang if there is a time element to please prioritize Eric I think it is better not to store several copies of the phenotype data for several reasons disk harder to keep track of all copies and to comply with the and more work to update when new releases better if you get access to the main folders and then use there is a need to create derived datasets for other or with subsets of and that is fine that can be stored in own And Stefan is currently downloading the full genomic was about done a few days Erik Erik FAHA Professor of Stanford University On Jun at Lu Zhang Hi We access the phenotype data in is it possible to copy these data to And I found the completed genotype data individuals recently released in shall we update the pilot genotype data on Sherlock Eric Erik Ingelsson

Erik Erik FAHA Professor of Stanford University On May at Lu Zhang Hi I am unable to touch the folder could you ask Kilian to add me to the project user Eric Erik Ingelsson Sounds Erik Erik FAHA Professor of Stanford University On May at Lu Zhang Dear Erik I can try to download these bulk data and let you know if they are Eric James Zou Sounds Eric Zhang will take care of James On May at Erik Ingelsson Hi Sounds my understanding is that you should be able to create subfolders in the ukbb so I suggest that you download them to two new That way we can share the data with other Stanford projects in the future without necessary sharing both imaging and accelerometry that we can personalize it a bit Let me know if it work to create these subfolders or if there are any problems with downloading the Erik Erik FAHA Professor of Stanford University On May at James Zou Hi We can now download the imaging and accelerometry data to Sherlock emails Could you coordinate with Stephane
