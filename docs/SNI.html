you both his message and my as I suggested he reach out to you his Please pass this message off to the storage be setting up a new research group soon and I have questions about setting up authentication and access controls based on kerberos authentication for my We will have client desktop machines some computational servers and a data server or two head node with ZFS to a SAS JBOD supporting Our previous infrastructure has been done via a local authentication infrastructure and against a JBOD running on ZFS and It but managing users is a In my I do think I will still need to maintain my own data JBODs and computational but I would like to simplify the user management of these would be done via kerberos all in a single The client machines will be linux maybe some but windows support is not necessary nor and the goal is to mount both network homes and network data volumes off the JBOD using the kerberos happy doing this via NFS or but not sold on either solution Ideally this would be relatively high performing gig links are in place between computation nodes and data JBOD head I also would like to support ACLs for complex permissions and There will be various levels of trust based on the user and collaborators might have read access only to some data and no write grad students might have read access and some write access to certain senior grad students have higher levels of all of these permissions would be managed centrally via some kind of nested group management or Transport or storage encryption is not necessary at this as things will be on private Is such a setup Am I asking for too reasonably competent with and do kerberos based authentication for access some but I have never tied volume to Can this be done via the credentials or does every client machine have to have its own independent if my vision of this is so far off that there is an obviously better way of doing then please hesitate to speak up with better still months away from buying and building the equipment so I have time to I just want to do it and my that I just Good I just saw your ticket in the Kerberos and though not in that I still have so I wanted to send a Congrats on the new research on the authentication you can definitely use Kerberos for authentication on all of your Each system will need a Kerberos client installed the package on and I also suggest installing the as that is the easiest way for you to get a host keytab for each Once each system has its host keytab you can configure the PAM module on to handle the authentication and More information on wallet is Each system will likely need three The host to handle system logins other tasks An nfs to handle authentication if using with Kerberos authentication An ldap to handle authentication if using LDAP for account information Next up is the account information It is possible to have your systems use the Directory central LDAP to store all of your account Every SUNetID has the necessary LDAP including the gidNumber and To get you would submit a directory access request for your by providing their host principal names as More information on the request process is You would likely request access to the and and in your request you would specify a so that your systems only see information for people who are in that This is what would provide your access If someone is in the then they can log The login shell typically defaults to Whatever login shell you get when you connect to the corn cluster is the login shell that is set in I believe Research or the can help if anyone wants to change their login The home directory in LDAP points to each AFS home Because of you may wish to install the AFS client on each just so that people can access their common home and other AFS In this also suggest putting a local directory on each system for local scratch Workgroups can map to groups in LDAP are called but that needs to be set up for each Once you have the workgroups put in a HelpSU requesting the POSIX groups be A lot of information is The HelpSU link need is Next up is the file storage Out of the two options you AFS certainly has the rich it is not appropriate for your because OpenAFS does not scale it scales If you have a low number of file find that OpenAFS will only be able to use a few CPU so it come anywhere near maxing out your There is a commercial successor to called that I understand is going to be rolled out at Auristor addresses the but it is commercial which might put you off of that brings us to If you want any kind of good ACL then want to use integrates nicely with and gives support for extended which definitely More information is in the man available online Exact setup is too much for me to go into a Debian page that covers the IMPORTANT If you want to use Kerberos and that authentication is also used to handle access to file then need to make sure that Kerberos credentials are kept including on the compute One way to deal with this is to ensure when a job is being the submitter uses the command to get a renewable Kerberos which will get passed along to the compute Our Kerberos environment allows credentials to be renewed for up to a The krenew and programs are available in the and can be found online now that exploded this ticket with some stuff to think about in the short Think about how you want to architect your Do you want separate workgroups for and then Or are there other dimensions that need to be You can start creating workgroups and requesting POSIX groups without needing any I also should note that Research Computing has experience is if not of what talked about in this Even if you want to use their services on an ongoing basis I strongly you should at least see if their willing to consult in the initial Before I one other Set up Puppet on each and use it to manage your use the Debian or CentOS build services to deploy Although there is time using Puppet for central system

but I want to give you both his message and my as I suggested he reach out to you his Please pass this message off to the storage be setting up a new research group soon and I have questions about setting up authentication and access controls based on kerberos authentication for my We will have client desktop machines some computational servers and a data server or two head node with ZFS to a SAS JBOD supporting Our previous infrastructure has been done via a local authentication infrastructure and against a JBOD running on ZFS and It but managing users is a In my I do think I will still need to maintain my own data JBODs and computational but I would like to simplify the user management of these would be done via kerberos all in a single The client machines will be linux maybe some but windows support is not necessary nor and the goal is to mount both network homes and network data volumes off the JBOD using the kerberos happy doing this via NFS or but not sold on either solution Ideally this would be relatively high performing gig links are in place between computation nodes and data JBOD head I also would like to support ACLs for complex permissions and There will be various levels of trust based on the user and collaborators might have read access only to some data and no write grad students might have read access and some write access to certain senior grad students have higher levels of all of these permissions would be managed centrally via some kind of nested group management or Transport or storage encryption is not necessary at this as things will be on private Is such a setup Am I asking for too reasonably competent with and do kerberos based authentication for access some but I have never tied volume to Can this be done via the credentials or does every client machine have to have its own independent if my vision of this is so far off that there is an obviously better way of doing then please hesitate to speak up with better still months away from buying and building the equipment so I have time to I just want to do it and my that I just Good I just saw your ticket in the Kerberos and though not in that I still have so I wanted to send a Congrats on the new research on the authentication you can definitely use Kerberos for authentication on all of your Each system will need a Kerberos client installed the package on and I also suggest installing the as that is the easiest way for you to get a host keytab for each Once each system has its host keytab you can configure the PAM module on to handle the authentication and More information on wallet is Each system will likely need three The host to handle system logins other tasks An nfs to handle authentication if using with Kerberos authentication An ldap to handle authentication if using LDAP for account information Next up is the account information It is possible to have your systems use the Directory central LDAP to store all of your account Every SUNetID has the necessary LDAP including the gidNumber and To get you would submit a directory access request for your by providing their host principal names as More information on the request process is You would likely request access to the and and in your request you would specify a so that your systems only see information for people who are in that This is what would provide your access If someone is in the then they can log The login shell typically defaults to Whatever login shell you get when you connect to the corn cluster is the login shell that is set in I believe Research or the can help if anyone wants to change their login The home directory in LDAP points to each AFS home Because of you may wish to install the AFS client on each just so that people can access their common home and other AFS In this also suggest putting a local directory on each system for local scratch Workgroups can map to groups in LDAP are called but that needs to be set up for each Once you have the workgroups put in a HelpSU requesting the POSIX groups be A lot of information is The HelpSU link need is Next up is the file storage Out of the two options you AFS certainly has the rich it is not appropriate for your because OpenAFS does not scale it scales If you have a low number of file find that OpenAFS will only be able to use a few CPU so it come anywhere near maxing out your There is a commercial successor to called that I understand is going to be rolled out at Auristor addresses the but it is commercial which might put you off of that brings us to If you want any kind of good ACL then want to use integrates nicely with and gives support for extended which definitely More information is in the man available online Exact setup is too much for me to go into a Debian page that covers the IMPORTANT If you want to use Kerberos and that authentication is also used to handle access to file then need to make sure that Kerberos credentials are kept including on the compute One way to deal with this is to ensure when a job is being the submitter uses the command to get a renewable Kerberos which will get passed along to the compute Our Kerberos environment allows credentials to be renewed for up to a The krenew and programs are available in the and can be found online now that exploded this ticket with some stuff to think about in the short Think about how you want to architect your Do you want separate workgroups for and then Or are there other dimensions that need to be You can start creating workgroups and requesting POSIX groups without needing any I also should note that Research Computing has experience is if not of what talked about in this Even if you want to use their services on an ongoing basis I strongly you should at least see if their willing to consult in the initial Before I one other Set up Puppet on each and use it to manage your use the Debian or CentOS build services to deploy Although there is time using Puppet for central system

whether it is a directory or The next three things are rwx for the for the first item it is sgagnon and the second it is The next spaces are for the group permissions this case and the next set are

better compute resources obviously behind the job Though the majority of the nodes have Gb the big memory nodes have and on Sherlock there are the Tb RAM nodes as Because at this point our compute

take advantage of Would SNI or other participating labs be able to cover part of the Otherwise I fear it make sense to have everyone your end as well as go to the trouble of migrating the data and also all of our analysis software to the Thanks Jonathan Original Message Judson June AM server Clandinin It is a sizable and glad that That would be the memory of the Proclus To configure your two

we were to consider moving our compute work away from has TB storage for your dedicated also backed We are happy to advise and assist with data I have just assisted getting data synced from Neurob and other labs have found it easy to mount storage and their migrate I saw Clandinin storage The second hurdle is actually the resources we have allocated to our I believe right now we have Gb RAM and for

setting up authentication and access controls based on kerberos authentication for my We will have client desktop machines some computational servers and a data server or two head node with ZFS to a SAS JBOD supporting Our previous infrastructure has been done via a local authentication infrastructure and against a JBOD running on ZFS and It but managing users is a In my I do think I will still need to maintain my own data JBODs and computational but I would like to simplify the user management of these would be done via kerberos all in a single The client machines will be linux maybe some but windows support is not necessary nor and the goal is to mount both network homes and network data volumes off the JBOD using the kerberos happy doing this via NFS or but not sold on either solution Ideally this would be relatively high performing gig links are in place between computation nodes and data JBOD head I also would like to support ACLs for complex permissions and There will be various levels of trust based on the user and collaborators might have read access only to some data and no write grad students might have read access and some write access to certain senior grad students have higher levels of all of these permissions would be managed centrally via some kind of nested group management or Transport or storage encryption is not necessary at this as things will be on private Is such a setup Am I asking for too reasonably competent with and do kerberos based authentication for access some but I have never tied volume to Can this be done via the credentials or does every client machine have to have its own independent if my vision of this is so far off that there is an obviously better way of doing then please hesitate to speak up with better still months away from buying and building the equipment so I have time to I just want to do it and my that I just Good I just saw your ticket in the Kerberos and though not in that I still have so I wanted to

suggest installing the as that is the easiest way for you to get a host keytab for each Once each system has its host keytab you can configure the PAM module on to handle the authentication and More information on wallet is Each system will likely need three The host to handle system logins other tasks An nfs to handle authentication if using with Kerberos authentication An ldap to handle authentication if using LDAP for account information Next up is the account information It is possible to have your systems use the Directory central LDAP to store all of your account Every SUNetID has the necessary LDAP including the gidNumber and To get you would submit a directory access request for your by providing their host principal names as More information on the request process is You would likely request access to the and and in your request you would specify a so that your systems only see information for people who are in that This is what would provide your access If someone is in the then they can log The login shell typically defaults to Whatever login shell you get when you connect to the corn cluster is the login shell that is set in I believe Research or the can help if anyone wants to change their login The home directory in LDAP points to each AFS home Because of you may wish to install the AFS client on each just so that people can access their common home and other AFS In this also suggest putting a local directory on each system for local scratch Workgroups can map to groups in LDAP are called but that needs to be set up for each Once you have the workgroups put in a HelpSU requesting the POSIX groups be A lot of information is The HelpSU link need is Next up is the file storage Out of the two options you AFS certainly has the rich it is not appropriate for your because OpenAFS does not scale it scales If you have a low number of file find that OpenAFS will only be able to use a few CPU so it come anywhere near maxing out your There is a commercial successor to called that I understand is going to be rolled out at Auristor addresses the but it is commercial which might put you off of that brings us to If you want any kind of good ACL then want to use integrates nicely with and gives support for extended which definitely More information is in the man available online Exact setup is too much for me to go into a Debian page that covers the IMPORTANT If you want to use Kerberos and that authentication is also used to handle access to file then need to make sure that Kerberos credentials are kept including on the compute One way to deal with this is to ensure when a job is being the submitter uses the command to get a renewable Kerberos which will get passed along to the compute Our Kerberos environment allows credentials to be renewed for up to a The krenew and programs are available in the and can be found online now that exploded this ticket with some stuff to think about in the short Think about how you want to architect your Do you want separate workgroups for and then Or are there other dimensions that need to be You can start creating workgroups and requesting POSIX groups without needing any I also should note that Research Computing has experience is if not of what talked about in this Even if you want to use their services on an ongoing basis I strongly you should at least see if their willing to consult in the initial Before I one other Set up Puppet on each and use it to manage your use the Debian or CentOS build services to deploy Although there is time using Puppet for central system

by so a little tricky for me to meet in I could potentially be available this afternoon at but I think the more important person to meet with is since as I indicated before pretty comfortable with our current compute resources so the SNI cluster would primarily be a resource for the lab moving would this work for Jonathan Original Message Judson June AM server and I understand your I would like a chance to present all the details and aspects in Now that we are discussing pros and finding it difficult to convey some of the nuances via I promise to keep it short if your schedules are Would you be able to meet this afternoon or anytime or Charlie Original Message Judson June AM server Hi a very large investment especially when the big nodes on both Proclus and Sherlock already offer equal or better compute resources obviously behind the job Though the majority of the nodes have Gb the big memory nodes have and on Sherlock there are the Tb RAM nodes as Because at this point our compute work is not really hindered by resource not clear that investment really buys much more than what we have access to currently of course the the data are all additional benefits that we would like to take advantage of Would SNI or other participating labs be able to cover part of the Otherwise I fear it make sense to have everyone your end as well as go to the trouble of migrating the data and also all of our analysis software to the Thanks Jonathan Original Message Judson June AM server Clandinin It is a sizable and glad that That would be the memory of the Proclus To configure your two nodes up to ram each here are the details it would be best if you ordered directly in Stanford That is dimms for each at If that looks good and you then I can send the SmartMart shopping cart to your

often Could you give us a price for the memory copying who holds the purse Thanks Jonathan Original Message Judson June AM server Jonathan Will is very much still just reaching out to answer questions like yours and see how I can I will attempt to answer inline I have a feeling that a short meeting or demo would be so I offered that and remain So to answer as best I can Hi Thanks for reaching Will Law was our original point person for SNI cluster administration should I be working with you on this from now We are both working on the project Having lab signed up to participate is actually been using proclus for nearly all of my cluster and Proclus have some significant I answer some details Users running big distributed jobs on Proclus should consider Sherlock See the Proclus page for details and by now we have Tb of data that we store there our project and backed up as well on a physically separate moving all of our data to the SNI cluster would be the first hurdle to get over if we were to consider moving our compute work away from has TB storage for your dedicated also backed We are happy to advise and assist with data I have just assisted getting data synced from Neurob and other labs have found it easy to mount storage and their migrate I saw Clandinin storage The second hurdle is actually the resources we have allocated to our I believe right now we have Gb RAM and for most needs this is more than but we routinely require typically around double that for some Would it be possible to outfit a machine with has blades with GB ram each dedicated for your We can upgrade
