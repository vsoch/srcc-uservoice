same it is uncertain if rstan with multiple cores can scale to the number of In simple if you say cores for the speed up could be any where from to depending on the and it could be that using cores

PMOD an interactive on a This might work if you opened a display tunneled from the but then you would be running things on one Being able to run their GUI on a node still let you scale you would just be running PMOD on a different computer So I think you should java feel free to copy paste the above ask them for specific install and is there programmatic access to the suite of is there a batch processing utility that would let you set up jobs a graphical user but then submit with different run commands to different For SPM is also a GUI program in but it has a batch utility called the that lets you configure and run the same things all from a command non would also want to correct the PMOD helper person mentioned that supercomputing is intended for parallel processing of small portions of and she might be thinking of something like spark with but incorrect to say that it must be parallel processing of small Supercomputing with a job is also optimized for or small processing of large

calculation explicitly to account for the distribution of your computational If you do want to use multiple then you need to distribute your workload to different This can be done by building a tf graph that maps to the multiple Please see if this can you are running into problems with the amount of memory on you may just use the cpu only since has much more memory will allocate an interactive

when multiple processes are compiling R code the compilation usually I believe these are the causes of the problems we What you can do for this is to see if you can turn off the recompilation of rstan even if a new model is Another option is to see if there is a rstan package that require I think either option could be Without it is possible to run rstan itself in using up to all the cores on the same it is uncertain if rstan with multiple cores can scale to the number of In simple if you say cores for the speed up could be any where from to depending on the and it could be that using cores turns out to be slower than just You can try to see how much you can speed up rstan using multiple cores and see how many cores will give you the optimal Probably you can make a decision which of the

to all the memory on that If you ask for more than one you need to deal with the communications between the That very much depends on the code you write and the tf It is likely that you have to write code to set up the communication between GPU is the number of nodes you ask If you have more than one nodes and each node has multiple then you are n the situation of You have to set up your calculation explicitly to account for the distribution of your computational If you do want to use multiple then you need to distribute your workload to different This can be done by building a tf graph that maps to the multiple Please see if this can you are running into problems with the amount of memory on you may just use the cpu only since has much more memory will allocate an interactive job on node in the queues listed and all the memories on that This allocates only so tf will not use the gpu but has all the memory available If this still turns out that there is not enough memory

members of his group can submit jobs to all and the one giving the soonest initiation time will run the job You can list them comma separated in your should reduce pending time quite a hns partition

when multiple processes are compiling R code the compilation usually I believe these are the causes of the problems we What you can do for this is to see if you can turn off the recompilation of rstan even if a new model is Another option is to see if there is a rstan package that require I think either option could be Without it is possible to run rstan itself in using up to all the cores on the same it is uncertain if rstan with multiple cores can scale to the number of In simple if you say cores for the speed up could be any where from to depending on the and it could be that using cores turns out to be slower than just You can try to see how much you can speed up rstan using multiple cores and see how many cores will give you the optimal Probably you can make a decision which of the two options you want to explore If you want to stop by I can be available from to on Zhiyong", "I am an undergraduate at This summer I have been working in engineering computing division and wanted to explore these topics more upon my return in the Does the Stanford computing teams allow students to participate in managing these environments and if how would one get Thank Milan", "HI Are you from

that depned on it know where to find the Typically you need and the INCLUDE variables properly Zhiyong", "Good to know that you are attending the OSG User I do not know that much detail of HTCondor but there are likely an option to tell HTCondor that the files are local to the compute cluster already so there is no need to transfer They made much efforts to make sure that HTCondor is aware of file transfer paths since many times file transfer is a bottleneck for You still need to figure out what are the parameters that control the HTCondor file Again there may be a parameter in HTCondor to partition jobs among different compute For particular ways of partition you may check with the OSG the HTCondor philosophy is that it automatically routes computation to different if you submit jobs to both Sherlock and other resources through HTCondor will load balance the computation Zhiyong", "Hi You can run in the normal queue for up to The long may take a long time to schedule your sinfo will show the queues you have access sbatch should allow you to run for Please note the time specification is in For all the you can try", "Hi How much storage do you Is it for longer term storage or mostly What kind of simulation tools you I have listed a number of web pages for your quick If you use Linux the Sherlock cluster may be the best choice and very likely it should meet most of your For longer term storage we offer oak at a very low Let us know a little bit more details of your simulation needs and hopefully we can help you figure out what resources you need and what we can For Stanford Research Computing the Sherlock cluster open to Stanford the oak storage Zhiyong", "Moving you to Hi Nice to meet Can you send me some information on the research objectives NIH links I will

long out of If we want to keep it need to at least upgrade the OS to a modern which would in turn require upgrading the It looks like running an old ruby maybe a newer the machine is very be good to buy a newer Alex Chekholko", "Thank you so much follow up with Kilian I think we will do the Google drive Backup seems the most Heke will be the administrator on the Kindest Eliza Adams", "Hi I think our plans are a bit up in the but we plan to keep primary copies of our data onsite in and then would like to host identical capacity with you for We can and maintain all systems and can add auxiliary equipment remote if So we mostly just need rack and physical access to wherever this rack space is in the interest of giving ourselves a bit of like to request if I need my own Our department is indeed under but not sure allowed to use or who contact to get permission for I can ask around on our side to determine who I need to talk but as another would it be a possibility to get our department to purchase a fixed capacity with you as Please let me know if I can clarify and thanks for your Brooks", "Hi The gcc version can be accessed with load This one should be compatible with
